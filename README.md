> Built in collaboration with my teammates Theeran, Seongjun, and Leo. Re-uploaded code to my profile for visibility.

This repository documents my team and I's NASA GeneLab research project, including the original GeneLab RNA-seq computational notebooks and the enhanced bioinformatics pipeline developed by our team to investigate spaceflight-associated transcriptomic adaptations. Our analytical extensions include data preprocessing optimization, differential gene expression modeling, pathway enrichment analysis, and structured reproducibility improvements designed to uncover molecular signatures relevant to astronaut health and long-duration spaceflight.
